# Introduction

Passenger: Passphrase Manager is a secure and open-source password manager that allows you to store your passphrases and secrets in your own cloud storage or desktop computer.

Designed to be simple and easy to use. Provides a simple and intuitive user interface. It is a cross-platform application so you can use it on your ==Linux==, ==BSD==, ==Windows==, ==Mac==, ==Android==, and ==iOS== devices. Also available as a ==web application==, so you can access your passphrases from any device with a modern web browser.

## Why Use Passenger?

There are many password managers available, so why use Passenger? Here are a few reasons:

*Built by a nerd for nerds.*

- **Open Source:** You can verify the source code and build the application yourself. You can also contribute to the project.
- **Self-Hosted:** You can store your passphrases ==in your own cloud== storage or desktop computer.
- **Cloud is Optional:** You can use Passenger without cloud storage. You can use it as a ==desktop app==. So you may consider using a version control system to manage your encrypted passphrases. You can use ==Git== or ==Mercurial==.
- **Forces You to Be Secure:** Passenger does not allow you to use weak passphrases. You cannot use a passphrase that is in the ==RockYou.txt== file. Yes, your passphrase is checked against the ==brute-force dictionary lists==. This means you are safe against ==14 million passphrases== in the list.
- **Self Employed Detective:** Passenger is also a detective.
  - Checks for ==duplicate passphrases==.
  - Checks passphrases for ==similar with username== or email address.
  - Checks ==old passphrases== that have not been changed for over a year.
  - Checks ==weak passphrases==. 8 characters is the minimum acceptable length, but they are still considered weak.
  - Keeps you up to date with the ==latest data breaches==.
  - Lets you know if any of your passphrases are in the ==leaked databases==.
